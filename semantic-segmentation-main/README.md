This repository provides an overview and code examples for image semantic segmentation using Depth Prediction Transformers (DPTs). Image semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves assigning a specific label to each pixel in an image, enabling fine-grained understanding and analysis of image content. DPTs, which combine vision transformers with an encoder-decoder framework, offer a powerful approach to image semantic segmentation, capturing global context, modeling long-range dependencies, and producing accurate segmentation maps.
